### Dictionaries and nestings review
## Dictionaries have two parts a key, and then an associated value or definition of the key.
## Example given is a table with two columns, key and value
## Python syntax is {key: value}

programming_dictionary = {
    "Bug": "An error in a program that prevents the program from running as expected.",
    "Function": "A piece of code that you can easily call over and over again.",
    "Loop": "The action of doing something over and over again.",
                          }

# Retrieve list syntax is list[index]
# Dictionary elements are identified by their key versus index
print(programming_dictionary["Bug"])
